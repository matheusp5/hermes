# Hermes ðŸ“¨
Hermes is a simple library built with .NET 7.0 and C# that was created in 2023 with the aim of helping developers create Socket Apps, both on Client-Side and Server-Side.

## How to install
We do not yet support the C# package manager, NuGet. However, it is possible to use Hermes with .dll! For you to use it, you need to go to the 'releases' section here on github and download the latest version. Another way is downloading the source code and compiling it manually.
